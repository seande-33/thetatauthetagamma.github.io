You definitely\n                                    want to introduce yourself to as many brothers and other Rushees as you can at every Rush event.\n                                    This is the best way to show your interest in the fraternity. Relax and have fun! Many rushees\n                                    walk away from Rush with some unexpected but important friendships.\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"card\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingNine\">\n                                <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\n                                    <button class=\"btn btn-link faq-btn\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseNine\" aria-expanded=\"true\" aria-controls=\"collapseNine\">\n                                        What kind of time commitment is Theta Tau?\n                                    </button>\n                                </h5>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapseNine\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingNine\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\n                                <div class=\"card-body\">\n                                    Rush is intended to be low time commitment activity, and usually only about 4-6 hours per week\n                                    (this is about the same as 1 credit class). Once you move further in the process and become a\n                                    pledge, more commitment will be expected of you. Your time commitment may average closer to 8-10\n                                    hours, however your time will be well spent developing meaningful relationships with brothers\n                                    and fellow pledges. Note that Rushing and Pledging are more rewarding the more time you invest\n                                    in them. It is ultimately up to you to manage your time in a way to make the proper time\n                                    commitment to the fraternity.\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"card\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingTen\">\n                                <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\n                                    <button class=\"btn btn-link faq-btn\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseTen\" aria-expanded=\"true\" aria-controls=\"collapseTen\">\n                                        Am I eligible to join?\n                                    </button>\n                                </h5>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapseTen\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingTen\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\n                                <div class=\"card-body\">\n                                    <p>As a quick checklist, you are eligible to join Theta Tau as long as long you can meet the following criteria at the time of your initiation:</p>\n\n                                    <ul>\n                                        <li>Enrolled at the College of Engineering</li>\n                                        <li>Have at least 6 months before graduation</li>\n                                        <li>Have a minimum (passing GPA) of 2.0</li>\n                                        <li>Not be a member of a competing Fraternity or Sorority</li>\n                                    </ul>\n                                </div>\n                            </div>\n                        </div>\n\n                        <div class=\"card\">\n                            <div class=\"card-header\" id=\"headingEleven\">\n                                <h5 class=\"mb-0\">\n                                    <button class=\"btn btn-link faq-btn\" data-toggle=\"collapse\" data-target=\"#collapseEleven\" aria-expanded=\"true\" aria-controls=\"collapseEleven\">\n                                        How do I pronounce \"Theta Tau\"?\n                                    </button>\n                                </h5>\n                            </div>\n                            <div id=\"collapseEleven\" class=\"collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"headingEleven\" data-parent=\"#accordion\">\n                                <div class=\"card-body\">\n                                    THAY-Ta TAH.
