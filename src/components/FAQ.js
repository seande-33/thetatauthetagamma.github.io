                                    Fraternities and Sororities are what many
                                    people refer to "Greek Life"â€” societies that
                                    induct members for lifetime membership.
                                    Sororities are all-female Greek
                                    Organizations, while Fraternities can be
                                    both all-male and co-ed Organizations. Each
                                    organization has certain rules and values
                                    that make each one unique; however, they are
                                    often considered either "Social" or
                                    "Professional" groups. Professional Greek
                                    Organizations have strong focus on
                                    developing their members professionally as
                                    well as creating a strong Brotherhood or
                                    Sisterhood.

                                    Honor societies are great for being around
                                    people that share an academic interest with
                                    you. These are excellent groups for
                                    furthering your interests in a topic, but
                                    the benefits often stop there. Because Theta
                                    Tau is a brotherhood, you will a join a
                                    group of people that take friendships beyond
                                    the classroom and even the campus, and treat
                                    you like part of a family. You will connect
                                    with a group of people that have a diverse
                                    range of interests, which helps you
                                    diversify the kinds of contacts you make,
                                    and opens up opportunities beyond your
                                    major. And yet, Theta Tau will provide you
                                    will some of the greatest memories in
                                    college, 4 years that you don't want to just
                                    spend stuck in a textbook.

                                    experience. First, attend our Rush events.
                                    There, you'll get to introduce yourself to
                                    our Brothers and get a feel for what the
                                    fraternity is like. Our rush events are
                                    typically low-stress, and simple activities
                                    that provide ample opportunity to hang out
                                    with Brothers. Then, you will be given a
                                    bid, which is an invitation to become a
                                    pledge with the Fraternity. After accepting
                                    your bid, you will become a pledge and start
                                    the process to becoming a brother!

                                    Rush is typically at the beginning of the
                                    academic semester. Rush events are
                                    low-stress, simple activities that are
                                    designed to help get exposure to the
                                    fraternity, and for Brothers to meet you.
                                    Our first rush events are typically
                                    Information Sessions where our Rush chairs
                                    will give you a in-depth explanation of the
                                    process to becoming a Brother of Theta Tau.
                                    Other Rush events will be a mix of fun and
                                    professional events that vary from Semester
                                    to Semester. You definitely want to
                                    introduce yourself to as many brothers and
                                    other Rushees as you can at every Rush
                                    event. This is the best way to show your
                                    interest in the fraternity. Relax and have
                                    fun! Many rushees walk away from Rush with
                                    some unexpected but important friendships.

                                    Rush is intended to be low time commitment
                                    activity, and usually only about 4-6 hours
                                    per week (this is about the same as 1 credit
                                    class). Once you move further in the process
                                    and become a pledge, more commitment will be
                                    expected of you. Your time commitment may
                                    average closer to 8-10 hours, however your
                                    time will be well spent developing
                                    meaningful relationships with brothers and
                                    fellow pledges. Note that Rushing and
                                    Pledging are more rewarding the more time
                                    you invest in them. It is ultimately up to
                                    you to manage your time in a way to make the
                                    proper time commitment to the fraternity.
