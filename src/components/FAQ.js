                <h3 className="faq-question"> What are fraternities and sororities? </h3>
                <p>
                    Fraternities and Sororities are what many people refer to "Greek Life"â€” societies
                    that induct members for lifetime membership. Sororities are all-female Greek
                    Organizations, while Fraternities can be both all-male and co-ed Organizations.
                    Each organization has certain rules and values that make each one unique; however,
                    they are often considered either "Social" or "Professional" groups. Professional
                    Greek Organizations have strong focus on developing their members professionally as
                    well as creating a strong Brotherhood or Sisterhood.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> What kind of Greek organization is Theta Tau? </h3>
                <p>Theta Tau is a Co-ed Professional Engineering Fraternity. This makes us a "Professional"
                    fraternity, which means we value the professional development and conduct of our members
                    more than a social fraternity might. We are also composed of members that have an interest
                    in Engineering, which unites us as another common focus. Finally, we are co-ed, and
                    accept members of all genders.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> What is Rushing? </h3>
                <p>Rushing is an interesting term to describe the first interactions you have with Greek
                    organization. Theta Tau's Rush week is designed to introduce you to the Fraternity and
                    it's members. You don't have to be an Engineer to attend Theta Tau rush events, and you
                    are allowed to Rush other Greek fraternities and sororities while rushing Theta Tau.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> I've heard that Fraternities haze their members. Does Theta Tau do this as well? </h3>
                <p>
                    Theta Tau is Professional fraternity, and we <strong>absolutely do not tolerate hazing</strong>.
                    For that matter, we are also a "dry" fraternity, and do not spend money on alcohol nor do we permit
                    alcohol at our events, including Rush Events. We uphold a strict Risk Management policy to protect
                    the reputation of the Fraternity and protect our interest in maintaining professionalism.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> Do I need to be an Engineer to join? </h3>
                <p>
                    We do not require you to be an Engineer to rush with us. And once you are brother,
                    you won't lose your membership if you decide to leave the College of Engineering
                    or pursue another major. The only condition we do require is that you are in the
                    College of Engineering at the time of your initiation. This means if you are in the
                    process of applying to the College, you shouldn't count yourself out!
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> How is Theta Tau different from an Honor Society? </h3>
                <p>
                    Honor societies are great for being around people that share an academic interest with
                    you. These are excellent groups for furthering your interests in a topic, but the benefits
                    often stop there. Because Theta Tau is a brotherhood, you will a join a group of people
                    that take friendships beyond the classroom and even the campus, and treat you like part
                    of a family. You will connect with a group of people that have a diverse range of interests,
                    which helps you diversify the kinds of contacts you make, and opens up opportunities beyond
                    your major. And yet, Theta Tau will provide you will some of the greatest memories in college,
                    4 years that you don't want to just spend stuck in a textbook.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> How do I join Theta Tau? </h3>
                <p>
                    Joining Theta Tau itself is a great experience. First, attend our Rush events. There, you'll
                    get to introduce yourself to our Brothers and get a feel for what the fraternity is like.
                    Our rush events are typically low-stress, and simple activities that provide ample opportunity
                    to hang out with Brothers. Then, you will be given a bid, which is an invitation to become a
                    pledge with the Fraternity. After accepting your bid, you will become a pledge and start the
                    process to becoming a brother!
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> What can I expect at Rush Events? </h3>
                <p>
                    Rush is typically at the beginning of the academic semester. Rush events are low-stress, simple
                    activities that are designed to help get exposure to the fraternity, and for Brothers to meet
                    you. Our first rush events are typically Information Sessions where our Rush chairs will give
                    you a in-depth explanation of the process to becoming a Brother of Theta Tau. Other Rush events
                    will be a mix of fun and professional events that vary from Semester to Semester. You definitely
                    want to introduce yourself to as many brothers and other Rushees as you can at every Rush event.
                    This is the best way to show your interest in the fraternity. Relax and have fun! Many rushees
                    walk away from Rush with some unexpected but important friendships.
                </p>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question"> What kind of time commitment is Theta Tau? </h3>
                <p>
                    Rush is intended to be low time commitment activity, and usually only about 4-6 hours per week
                    (this is about the same as 1 credit class). Once you move further in the process and become a
                    pledge, more commitment will be expected of you. Your time commitment may average closer to 8-10
                    hours, however your time will be well spent developing meaningful relationships with brothers
                    and fellow pledges. Note that Rushing and Pledging are more rewarding the more time you invest
                    in them. It is ultimately up to you to manage your time in a way to make the proper time
                    commitment to the fraternity.

                <h3 className="faq-question"> Am I eligible to join? </h3>
                <p>As a quick checklist, you are eligible to join Theta Tau as long as long you can meet the following criteria at the time of your initiation:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Enrolled at the College of Engineering</li>
                    <li>Have at least 6 months before graduation</li>
                    <li>Have a minimum (passing GPA) of 2.0</li>
                    <li>Not be a member of a competing Fraternity or Sorority</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h3 className="faq-question">How do I pronounce "Theta Tau"? </h3>
                <p>
                    THAY-Ta TAH. Notice the pronunciation of "Tau" differs from the typical pronunciation you might
                    hear in a Math class. This is not by mistake, but rather a Greek Grammatical rule.
